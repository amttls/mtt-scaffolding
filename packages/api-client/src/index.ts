// Main exports - selective re-exports for common use cases
// For better tree-shaking, prefer direct imports from generated files:
// import { useGetUsers } from '@repo/api-client/generated/users';

// Placeholder exports - will be updated after generation
export const placeholder = "API client not yet generated";

// Re-export types that are commonly used
export type * from "./generated/models";
